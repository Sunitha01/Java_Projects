Make your changes to `src/main/Main.java` and add your api key to `src/main/resouces/api.properties`.

Before starting your assignment, you should run this command after you clone the project:
```
git update-index --assume-unchanged src/main/resources/api.properties
```
The above line will help you not accidentally commit your API key.

To run the application, run
```
mvn compile exec:java
```
