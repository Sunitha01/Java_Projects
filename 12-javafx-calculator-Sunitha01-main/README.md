# JavaFX Calculator
This simple calculator app is written in JavaFX.  The buttons and layout has already been created for you.  
You can look at `src/resouces/calculatr.fxml` to see how it is created, but you should not need to make any 
changes to this file.

Make your changes in `Calculator.java`.  There are instructions in that file in the form of TODO comments.

You can run your application with the following Maven command.
```
	mvn clean javafx:run
```

To run the automated test suite, use the following (note this might not run correctly on Windows):
```
mvn test
```
